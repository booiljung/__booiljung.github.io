## Experienced

My first programming was in MSX with basic and machine language, and I started by going to high school and learning about computing. The total experience is over 20 years.

#### 3D games and engines

At the time, the 3D engine was expensive, so I developed the engine part myself and applied it to the product. These games were embedded in the product and exported abroad.

- C ++ and OpenGL in Linux.
- Declarative programming for concise scene organization and interpreter implementation for artists.
- Implement a physics engine for interaction from the user.
- 6 years experienced.

#### iOS app development

I have developed and released a camera DVR and music player running on iOS.

- Use Xcode, Objective-C, C ++, Cocoa Tourch Framework in OSX environment.

#### Mobile game development

I have developed and released games targeting mobile.

- Target mobile in OSX environment, using Unity engine, C #, C ++, Objective-C.
- Implement plugins such as payments in C ++ and Objective-C, and call them from C #. Difficult to debug interfaces between different languages.
- 5 years experience.

#### Computer Vision and Machine Learning Studies

I'm researching a service for virtual fashion fitting.

#### Inhouse ERP system

I participated in the development of an in-house ERP system for performance measurement and client transactions.

- Analysis and design.
- Responsible for security modules such as cryptography and smart cards.
- Run on Web, Windows server and client, and Linux client environments.

#### Medical software

I have developed EMR software and provide it to our customers.

- .NET, C#, Python, HL7.
- Windows Service 및 .NET Winform Application.

#### Embedded system

I have developed electronics using embedded graphics processors, microcontrollers, C, assemblies and wired and wireless communication technologies in an embedded environment. Developed on Z80, MCS51, FPGA, V9938. It's an old technology, but it's still a valid experience for the IoT world where low cost and low power are required.

#### 2D games and SDK

I have created an SDK and graphics editing and processing tools for use in embedded environments. This technique is called sprites or fontmaps. The developed hardware and SDK were used to teach about 240 students at Hoseo University for 5 years.

- Editing and processing tools run in the Windows environment and use MFC and C ++.
- Emulation and Debugging in Windows Environments.
- Target hardware cross-compiled to 68K, FPGA, and HyperStone embedded environments.
- The target hardware SDK was developed in C, and only the parts requiring high speed parallel pipeline processing were implemented in Assembly.
- Support for in-house and third-party developers.

## Skills and Domain Knowledge

#### C/C++

Used for over 15 years and professional.

- C/C++, Assembly

#### C# 및 .NET (Service, Winform, HTTP ...)

Used for over 8 years and professional.

- C# .NET

#### Unity

Professional, mobile game development or human facial reconduction, SLAM, 3D Machine Vision research.

#### Cocoa Touch 및 Objective-C

I used it for about 2 years for iOS app development.

- Xcode
- Cocoa Tourch Framework.
- Objective-C, C ++

#### Image Processing, Computer Vision, Machine Learning

I'm interested and think of it as a way to solve problems that are difficult to programmatically solve. For the study of virtual fashion fittings, it was used in machine learning, image processing and computer vision.

- Signal Processing, Image Processing, Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Deep Learning. 3D reconstruction, 3D scan.
- Python, C++.
- Unity, Pytorch, Python, OpenCV, dlib.
- Understanding of DNN, GAN, AE, RNN, LSTM, GRU.
- Humal Facial Annotation, Human Pose Tracking.
- Camera, RealSense equipment.

#### WIN32, MFC, Delphi

I've used it professionally, but it's been a while since now. These experiences are used to call or implement native functions in C or C ++ if you need features that are not supported by frameworks such as .NET or need high-speed processing.

- Visual Studio, C/C++, WIN32 SDK, MFC.
- Dephi, Objective-Pascal, Visual Component.

#### Qt

Used additionally in the study of virtual fashion fitting. I used PyQt to display in Python, or Qt when using OpenCV with C ++. I configured the widget by calling the Qt API directly, and QtCreator and QML have no experience.

- C++, libqt
- Python, PyQt

#### 3D Graphics, OpenGL, GLSL

I have been using game engines and games in Linux for more than six years. I rarely use it since I used Unity.

- 3D graphics programming
- OpenGL, GLSL, C/C++
- Ogres

#### Dart, Flutter, Aqueduct

I developed CRM as a toy project, studying Dart, Flutter, a web and mobile or desktop framework, and Aqueduct, an HTTP API backend framework. I anticipate that these tools will be frameworks that have important positions in future web and app development.

- Dart
- Flutter
- Aqueduct, HTTP, PostgreSQL

#### Physics Engine

Although not an area of expertise, I have experience implementing OpenGL for user interaction in 3D game development. It was mainly implemented by combining projection, external product, internal product, and divisional conquest method. If you're using Unity, PhysX is built in and there's no chance of implementing it afterwards. Intermittent implementation of 3D reconstruction of image processing results.

#### Development environment

I use the following development targets or environments, tools.

- Windows, Linux, MacOS, Micro-controllers.
- SVN, git, docker.
- Markdown, LaTeX.
- Visual Studio, Xcode, Eclipce.

#### Engineering Mathematics

While not a math major, there are some cases where programming problems must be solved in mathematics.

- I'm constantly improving in linear algebra, statistics and analysis.

#### Analysis and Design

It is an important issue for identifying requirements, estimating costs, distributing work and measuring performance in medium to large challenges. Experienced in developing ERP system.

#### DBMS

I have 5 years of server side experience. For a DBMS, you only need to install it, create a database, a user, a table, etc., and use it to send and receive queries.

- PostgreSQL
- MySQL
- Oracle Database Server
- (MS) SQL Server
- Rabbit MQ

#### Parallel computing with the GPU

Parallel computing with the GPU is similar to shader programming. OpenMP, OpenACC, Metal Framework, CUDA, and OpenCL have been studied, but there are already high-level framework libraries that have never been used and are not professional.

#### DirectX, Vulkan, MetalKit

I mainly develop Linux target products, so I have less DirectX experience. (DirectDraw) or so.
Vulkan, MetalKit has no studies and experience.

#### Java, Ruby, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS

Learning is far from professional with just one level of learning.
