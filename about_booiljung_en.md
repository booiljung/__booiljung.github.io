## Experienced

#### 3D games and engines

At the time, the 3D engine was expensive, so I developed the engine part myself and applied it to the product. These games were embedded in the product and exported abroad.

- C ++ and OpenGL in Linux.
- Declarative programming for concise scene organization and interpreter implementation for artists.
- Implement a physics engine for interaction from the user.

#### iOS app development

I have developed and released a camera DVR and music player running on iOS.

- Use Xcode, Objective-C, C ++, Cocoa Tourch Framework in OSX environment.

#### Mobile game development

I have developed and released games targeting mobile.

- Target mobile in OSX environment, using Unity engine, C #, C ++, Objective-C.

#### Computer Vision and Machine Learning Studies

I'm researching a service for virtual fashion fitting.

- Signal Processing, Image Processing, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, 3D Reconstruction, 3D Scan.
- Unity, Pytorch, Python, OpenCV, dlib, C++ 사용.
- Use Dart, Flutter, and Aqueduct to implement web and mobile apps.
- Camera, RealSense equipment.

#### Medical software

- .NET, C#, Python, HL7.
- Windows Service 및 .NET Winform Application.

#### Embedded system

I have developed electronics using embedded graphics processors, microcontrollers, C, assemblies and wired and wireless communication technologies in an embedded environment. Developed on Z80, MCS51, FPGA, V9938. It's an old technology, but it's still a valid experience for the IoT world where low cost and low power are required.

#### 2D games and SDK

I have created an SDK and graphics editing and processing tools for use in embedded environments. This technique is called sprites or fontmaps. The developed hardware and SDK were used to teach about 240 students at Hoseo University for 5 years.

- Editing and processing tools run in the Windows environment and use MFC and C ++.
- Emulation and Debugging in Windows Environments.
- Target hardware cross-compiled to 68K, FPGA, and HyperStone embedded environments.
- The target hardware SDK was developed in C, and only the parts requiring high speed parallel pipeline processing were implemented in Assembly.
- Support for in-house and third-party developers.

## Skills and Domain Knowledge

#### C/C++

Used for over 15 years and professional.

#### C# 및 .NET (Service, Winform, HTTP ...)

Used for over 8 years and professional.

ASP.NET is inexperienced.

#### Unity

Professional. I have developed games for mobile and have used them for research on Human Facial Reconduction, SLAM, and 3D Machine Vision.

#### Cocoa Touch 및 Objective-C

I used it for about 2 years for iOS app development.

- Use Xcode, Objective-C, C ++, Cocoa Tourch Framework in OSX environment.

#### Signal Processing, Image Processing, Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Python, Pytorch, OpenCV, dlib ...

For the study of virtual fashion fittings, it was used in machine learning, image processing and computer vision.

#### Dart, Flutter, Aqueduct

After studying Flutter and Aqueduct, I developed CRM as a toy project. I expect these tools to be the frameworks of the future.

#### WIN32, MFC, 델파이

I've used it professionally, but it's been a while since now. These experiences are used to call or implement native functions in C or C ++ if you need features that are not supported by frameworks such as .NET or need high-speed processing.

#### Qt

Used additionally in the study of virtual fashion fitting. I used PyQt to display in Python, or Qt when using OpenCV with C ++. I configured the widget by calling the Qt API directly, and QtCreator and QML have no experience.

#### OpenGL, GLSL

Used for game engine and game development on Linux. It has been rarely used since Unity.

#### Physics Engine

Although not an area of expertise, I have experience implementing OpenGL for user interaction in 3D game development. It was mainly implemented by combining projection, external product, internal product, and divisional conquest method. If you're using Unity, PhysX is built in and there's no chance of implementing it afterwards. Intermittent implementation of 3D reconstruction of image processing results.

#### Development environment

I have experience implementing on microcontroller, Linux, Windows, iOS, and Mac based target platforms.

I use svn, git, jira for collaboration, I use docker for distribution, I use markdown, latex tools for documentation.

#### Engineering Mathematics

While not a math major, there are some cases where programming problems must be solved in mathematics. I'm constantly improving in linear algebra, statistics and analysis.

#### Analysis and Design

It is an important issue for identifying requirements, estimating costs, distributing work and measuring performance in medium to large challenges. Experienced in developing ERP system.

#### DirectX, Vulkan, MetalKit

I mainly develop Linux target products, so I have less DirectX experience. (DirectDraw) or so.
Vulkan, MetalKit has no studies and experience.

#### Parallel computing with the GPU

The Metal Framework, CUDA, and OpenCL have been studied, but there are already high-level framework libraries that have never been used and are not professional.

#### Java, Ruby, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS

Learning is far from professional with just one level of learning.
